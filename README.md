 The Territorial and Spatial Development GSG will focus on three major areas: (i) providing World Bank thought leadership on key issues relating to patterns of spatial economic development at the national, sub-national regional, and city levels; (ii) strengthening the quality of Bank operations and analytical work as they relate to issues of territorial and spatial development; and (iii) building a community of policy economists, urban specialists and development practitioners that functions as an informal team for collaboration, innovation and knowledge sharing.
